/* pseudocode detailing variable and constants of radio station
	constants are as follows
PRODUCTION = $100/hr
PRE-PRO = $60/hr
PRODUCER FEE = $40/hr

	variables are based off
the HOURS times the services rendered in the constants list
this produces several new variables

	Total Cost = production $/hr cost + pre-pro $ hr/cost + producer fee $ hr/cost*/
